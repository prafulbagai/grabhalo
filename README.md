grabhalo
========
A web messaging application. It is similar to grabHalo, but without the map. 

The program let the user:
1. login as a user and register new users
2. After logging in, be able to select other users that you want to message by checking off a list of users. The list looks like this: it has other users' names with check boxes next to each of their names. You can create a few dummy accounts.
3. have a text input field where you can type in a text message and press send

Features:-
If you login as a user who received the message, you'll be able to see the message that was sent to you (with the name of the sender) and send a message back to the original sender in the same thread, Or send a new message to the list of other users by creating a new thread.
If you login as a user who was not selected, you'll be able to login but NOT have received any message (obviously). Then You should be able to either respond back to other message threads, or choose who you would like to mass message and send a message to those people.
If you login as the original user who messaged many people, and have received messages back from multiple users, these should be separate threads and you should be able to communicate with each of these people in separate threads 1-1 via sending messages. Note, if you have heard back from the same person but from two different blast-messages, then these threads should be separate. 
  
You willalso be able to see past messages you have sent to people, and which people the message was sent to, EVEN if you don't receive a response from any of them.
